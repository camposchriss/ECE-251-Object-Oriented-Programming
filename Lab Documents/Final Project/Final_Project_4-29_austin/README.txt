This is the Readme for a Point of Service software written by Dustin Kendall
and Austin Richardson.
To get started, run the script. You will see a cashier GUI by defualt.
On the upper left lies the list view of items you've put in this order.
You can add more with the buttons on the upper right. You can correct wrong item
inputs by pressing the Remove button below the item buttons. To the left of that
is the Checkout button. It checks out the items bought, prints a receipt, and moves
onto the next order. Managers can press the manager button to navigate to a managers-
only menu. This menu allows you to void orders that customers were unsatisfied with
using the Void Order button at the bottom of the window. To return to the cashier menu,
use the Cashier Menu button below it. Voiding orders does not delete receipts,
because upper management needs to keep record of when orders are voided.
